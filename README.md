# Donald Markov Speech Writer: Why? Why not!

# Dependencies:
* markovify

`pip install markovify`

# Questions
## Why is this a thing?
Because it actually makes him sound better than what he sounds like now. Also, sometimes something good comes out from running the script and it's very hard to actually figure out what he actually said compared to what the Markov generator spits out.

## What does the roadmap for this project look like?
I really don't know. This was just something I whipped up in less then an afternoon.

## Can you do a Clinton one?
Eh, maybe. Somebody get me a corpus of her speeches and I might.
